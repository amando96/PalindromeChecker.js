A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Allowances may be made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers. Famous examples include "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Amor, Roma", "race car", "taco cat", and "No 'x' in Nixon".

This small function simply checks whether a phrase is a palindrome or not.
